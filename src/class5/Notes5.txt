Dropdown Menu:
    There are 2 types:
        1)Single select
        2)Multi select

    There is a class to deal with dropdown menus: Select clase. To use this class, the dropdown menu
    code must be place in <select> tag in DOM.

    Approach in Single Drop Down:
        1)Inspect the Dorp Down
        2)Check if it uses select tag
        3)Write a proper locator
        4)Decleare an object of select class
        5)Use methods from select class

Alerts:
    Alerts are pop ups that appear without dealing with them. We cannot inspect them.

    There are 3 types of alerts:
        1)JavaScript Alerts - On browser (We deal with them with SwitchTo commands)
            a)Simple Alert - Only ok button
            b)Confirmation Alert - Ok or Cancel buttons
            c)Prompt Alert - Alerts with text boxes
        2)HTML base alerts/pop ups - On website (We can deal with them in the same way we deal with the others)
        3)Window based - We cannot deal with them on Selenium.

WindowHandle:
    This is an unique code for every window. When we check and confirm by its title, we can focus on that window.
